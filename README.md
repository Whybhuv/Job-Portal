# Job-Portal
A job portal built using Node.js for backend and a user-friendly interface on React.js, with MongoDB for data storage. Cloudinary is used for file storage. A robust authentication was implemented, using JWT stored as cookies and ensured thorough validation during the registration process for both recruiters and applicants.
